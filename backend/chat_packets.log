The aim is to give transparency into our designs. That way you can have peace of mind in using Onyx.\\nAlternatively if youre looking to customize the system or become an open source contributors, this is a great place to start.\\n\\nSystem Architecture\\nWhether deploying Onyx on a single instance or a container orchestration platform, the flow of data is the same. Documents are pulled and processed via connectors and then persisted in Vespa/Postgres which run in containers within your system.\\nThe only time sensitive data leaves your Onyx setup is when it makes a call to an LLM to generate an answer. The communications to the LLM are encrypted. The data persistence at the LLM API depends on the terms of the LLM hosting service you are using.\\nWe also note that Onyx has some very limited and anonymous telemetry to help us improve the system by identifying bottlenecks and flaky data connectors. You can turn off the telemetry with by setting the DISABLE_TELEMETRY env variable to True.\\n\\nEmbedding Flow\\nEach document is split into smaller sections called Chunks.\\nBy passing chunks to the LLM instead of full documents, we are able to reduce noise to the model by only passing in the relevant sections of the document. Additionally this is significantly more cost efficient as LLM services generally charge per token. Finally by embedding chunks rather than full documents, we are able to retain more detail as each vector embedding is only capable of encoding a limited amount of information.\\nThe addition of mini-chunks takes this concept even further. By embedding at different sizes, Onyx can retrieve both high level context and details. Mini-chunks can also be turned on/off via environment variables as generating multiple vectors per chunk can slow down document indexing if deployed on less capable hardware.\\nIn choosing our embedding model, we use the latest state-of-the-art biencoder that is small enough to run on CPU while maintaining subsecond document retrieval times.\\n\\nQuery Flow\\nThis flow is often updated as were constantly striving to push the capabilities of the retrieval pipeline with the most recent advancements coming out of research and the opensource community.\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nExplanation of different system components and flows\\nThis page discusses how Onyx works from a high level.

You can connect up your own teams knowledge and you will be able to ask questions unique to your organization. Onyx will keep all of the knowledge up to date and in sync with your connected applications.\\n\\nIs my data being sent anywhere when I connect it up to Onyx?\\nAnswer: No! Onyx is built with data security as our highest priority. We open sourced it so our users can know exactly what is going on with their data. By default all of the document processing happens within Onyx. The only time it is sent outward is for the GenAI call to generate answers.\\n\\nWhere is the feature for auto sync-ing document level access permissions from all connected sources?\\nAnswer: This falls under the Enterprise Edition set of Onyx features built on top of the MIT/community edition.

Critical information is saved across a host of channels like call transcripts with prospects, engineering design docs, IT runbooks, customer support email exchanges, project management tickets, and more. As fast moving teams scale up, information gets spread out and more disorganized.\\nSince it quickly becomes infeasible to check across every source, decisions get made on incomplete information, employee satisfaction decreases, and the most valuable members of your team are tied up with constant distractions as junior teammates are unable to unblock themselves. Onyx solves this problem by letting anyone on the team access all of the knowledge across your organization in a permissioned and secure way. Users can ask questions in natural language and get back answers and documents across all of the connected sources instantly.\\n\\nWhats the Real Cost?\\nA typical knowledge worker spends over 2 hours a week on search, but more than that, the cost of incomplete or incorrect information can be extremely high. Customer support/success that isnt able to find the reference to similar cases could cause hours or even days of delay leading to lower customer satisfaction or in the worst case - churn. An account exec not realizing that a prospect had previously mentioned a specific need could lead to lost deals. An engineer not realizing a similar feature had previously been built could result in weeks of wasted development time and tech debt with duplicate implementation. With a lack of knowledge, your whole organization is navigating in the dark - inefficient and mistake prone.\\n\\nMore than Search\\nWhen analyzing the entire corpus of knowledge within your company is as easy as asking a question in a search bar, your entire team can stay informed and up to date. Onyx also makes it trivial to identify where knowledge is well documented and where it is lacking. Team members who are centers of knowledge can begin to effectively document their expertise since it is no longer being thrown into a black hole. All of this allows the organization to achieve higher efficiency and drive business outcomes.\\nWith Generative AI, the entire user experience has evolved as well. For example, instead of just finding similar cases for your customer support team to reference, Onyx breaks down the issue and explains it so that even the most junior members can understand it.\\nThis in turn lets them give the most holistic and technically accurate response possible to your customers. On the other end, even the super stars of your sales team will not be able to review 10 hours of transcripts before hopping on that critical call, but Onyx can easily parse through it in mere seconds and give crucial context to help your team close.\\nUse Cases Overview AI Platform\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nUse Cases\\nEnterprise Search\\nUse Cases\\nEnterprise Search\\nValue of Enterprise Search with Onyx\\n\\nWhat is Enterprise Search and why is it Important?\\nAn Enterprise Search system gives team members a single place to access all of the disparate knowledge of an organization.

The aim is to give transparency into our designs. That way you can have peace of mind in using Onyx.\\nAlternatively if youre looking to customize the system or become an open source contributors, this is a great place to start.\\n\\nSystem Architecture\\nWhether deploying Onyx on a single instance or a container orchestration platform, the flow of data is the same. Documents are pulled and processed via connectors and then persisted in Vespa/Postgres which run in containers within your system.\\nThe only time sensitive data leaves your Onyx setup is when it makes a call to an LLM to generate an answer. The communications to the LLM are encrypted. The data persistence at the LLM API depends on the terms of the LLM hosting service you are using.\\nWe also note that Onyx has some very limited and anonymous telemetry to help us improve the system by identifying bottlenecks and flaky data connectors. You can turn off the telemetry with by setting the DISABLE_TELEMETRY env variable to True.\\n\\nEmbedding Flow\\nEach document is split into smaller sections called Chunks.\\nBy passing chunks to the LLM instead of full documents, we are able to reduce noise to the model by only passing in the relevant sections of the document. Additionally this is significantly more cost efficient as LLM services generally charge per token. Finally by embedding chunks rather than full documents, we are able to retain more detail as each vector embedding is only capable of encoding a limited amount of information.\\nThe addition of mini-chunks takes this concept even further. By embedding at different sizes, Onyx can retrieve both high level context and details. Mini-chunks can also be turned on/off via environment variables as generating multiple vectors per chunk can slow down document indexing if deployed on less capable hardware.\\nIn choosing our embedding model, we use the latest state-of-the-art biencoder that is small enough to run on CPU while maintaining subsecond document retrieval times.\\n\\nQuery Flow\\nThis flow is often updated as were constantly striving to push the capabilities of the retrieval pipeline with the most recent advancements coming out of research and the opensource community.\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nExplanation of different system components and flows\\nThis page discusses how Onyx works from a high level.

This document will now show up in Onyxs search flows like any other webpage pulled in by a Web connector.\\ncurl --location 'localhost:8080/onyx-api/ingestion' \\\\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer dn_qODmg9r8Nl9PR4R9GF_z1UA0smcwVIcj58Ei0zWA' \\\\ --data '{ \\\"document\\\": { \\\"id\\\": \\\"ingestion_document_1\\\", \\\"sections\\\": [ { \\\"text\\\": \\\"This is the contents of the document that will be processed and saved into the vector+keyword document index. \\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://docs.onyx.app/introduction#what-is-onyx\\\" }, { \\\"text\\\": \\\"You can include multiple content sections each with their own link or combine them.\\n\\\", \\\"link\\\": \\\"https://docs.onyx.app/introduction#main-features\\\" } ], \\\"source\\\": \\\"web\\\", \\\"semantic_identifier\\\": \\\"Onyx Ingestion Example\\\", \\\"metadata\\\": { \\\"tag\\\": \\\"informational\\\", \\\"topics\\\": [\\\"onyx\\\", \\\"api\\\"] }, \\\"doc_updated_at\\\": \\\"2024-04-25T08:20:00Z\\\" }, \\\"cc_pair_id\\\": 1 }'\\nNote: The Bearer auth token is generated on server startup in Onyx MIT. There is better API Key support as part of Onyx EE.\\nSee below for a breakdown of the different fields provided:\\n- id : this is the unique ID of the document, if a document of this ID exists it will be updated/replaced. If not provided, a document ID is generated from the semantic_identifier field instead and returned in the response.\\n- sections : list of sections each containing textual content and an optional link. The document chunking tries to avoid splitting sections internally and favors splitting at section borders. Also the link of the document at query time is the link of the best matched section.\\n- source : Source type, full list can be checked by searching for DocumentSource here\\n- semantic_identifier : This is the Title of the document as shown in the UI (see image below)\\n- metadata : Used for the Tags feature which is displayed in the UI. The values can be either strings or list of strings\\n- doc_updated_at : The time that the document was last considered updated. By default there is a time based score decay around this value when the document is considered during search.\\n- cc_pair_id : This is the Connector ID seen on the Connector Status pages. For example, if running locally, it might be http://localhost:3000/admin/connector/2 . This allows attaching the ingestion doc to existing connectors so they can be assigned to groups or deleted together with the connector. If not provided or set to 1 explicitly, it is considered part of the default catch-all connector.\\nFor even more details, the code for the relevant object is found here , called DocumentBase\\n\\nChecking Ingestion Documents\\nAn API is also provided to fetch all of the documents that have been indexed via the Ingestion API\\nCustom Tools Answer with Quote\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nBackend APIs\\nIngestion API\\nBackend APIs\\nIngestion API\\nIngest Arbitrary Documents\\n\\nTypical uses for the Ingestion API\\nA set of backend APIs are provided to take in and process arbitrary document data sent directly to the backend API server.

Critical information is saved across a host of channels like call transcripts with prospects, engineering design docs, IT runbooks, customer support email exchanges, project management tickets, and more. As fast moving teams scale up, information gets spread out and more disorganized.\\nSince it quickly becomes infeasible to check across every source, decisions get made on incomplete information, employee satisfaction decreases, and the most valuable members of your team are tied up with constant distractions as junior teammates are unable to unblock themselves. Onyx solves this problem by letting anyone on the team access all of the knowledge across your organization in a permissioned and secure way. Users can ask questions in natural language and get back answers and documents across all of the connected sources instantly.\\n\\nWhats the Real Cost?\\nA typical knowledge worker spends over 2 hours a week on search, but more than that, the cost of incomplete or incorrect information can be extremely high. Customer support/success that isnt able to find the reference to similar cases could cause hours or even days of delay leading to lower customer satisfaction or in the worst case - churn. An account exec not realizing that a prospect had previously mentioned a specific need could lead to lost deals. An engineer not realizing a similar feature had previously been built could result in weeks of wasted development time and tech debt with duplicate implementation. With a lack of knowledge, your whole organization is navigating in the dark - inefficient and mistake prone.\\n\\nMore than Search\\nWhen analyzing the entire corpus of knowledge within your company is as easy as asking a question in a search bar, your entire team can stay informed and up to date. Onyx also makes it trivial to identify where knowledge is well documented and where it is lacking. Team members who are centers of knowledge can begin to effectively document their expertise since it is no longer being thrown into a black hole. All of this allows the organization to achieve higher efficiency and drive business outcomes.\\nWith Generative AI, the entire user experience has evolved as well. For example, instead of just finding similar cases for your customer support team to reference, Onyx breaks down the issue and explains it so that even the most junior members can understand it.\\nThis in turn lets them give the most holistic and technically accurate response possible to your customers. On the other end, even the super stars of your sales team will not be able to review 10 hours of transcripts before hopping on that critical call, but Onyx can easily parse through it in mere seconds and give crucial context to help your team close.\\nUse Cases Overview AI Platform\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nUse Cases\\nEnterprise Search\\nUse Cases\\nEnterprise Search\\nValue of Enterprise Search with Onyx\\n\\nWhat is Enterprise Search and why is it Important?\\nAn Enterprise Search system gives team members a single place to access all of the disparate knowledge of an organization.

The aim is to give transparency into our designs. That way you can have peace of mind in using Onyx.\\nAlternatively if youre looking to customize the system or become an open source contributors, this is a great place to start.\\n\\nSystem Architecture\\nWhether deploying Onyx on a single instance or a container orchestration platform, the flow of data is the same. Documents are pulled and processed via connectors and then persisted in Vespa/Postgres which run in containers within your system.\\nThe only time sensitive data leaves your Onyx setup is when it makes a call to an LLM to generate an answer. The communications to the LLM are encrypted. The data persistence at the LLM API depends on the terms of the LLM hosting service you are using.\\nWe also note that Onyx has some very limited and anonymous telemetry to help us improve the system by identifying bottlenecks and flaky data connectors. You can turn off the telemetry with by setting the DISABLE_TELEMETRY env variable to True.\\n\\nEmbedding Flow\\nEach document is split into smaller sections called Chunks.\\nBy passing chunks to the LLM instead of full documents, we are able to reduce noise to the model by only passing in the relevant sections of the document. Additionally this is significantly more cost efficient as LLM services generally charge per token. Finally by embedding chunks rather than full documents, we are able to retain more detail as each vector embedding is only capable of encoding a limited amount of information.\\nThe addition of mini-chunks takes this concept even further. By embedding at different sizes, Onyx can retrieve both high level context and details. Mini-chunks can also be turned on/off via environment variables as generating multiple vectors per chunk can slow down document indexing if deployed on less capable hardware.\\nIn choosing our embedding model, we use the latest state-of-the-art biencoder that is small enough to run on CPU while maintaining subsecond document retrieval times.\\n\\nQuery Flow\\nThis flow is often updated as were constantly striving to push the capabilities of the retrieval pipeline with the most recent advancements coming out of research and the opensource community.\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nExplanation of different system components and flows\\nThis page discusses how Onyx works from a high level.

Critical information is saved across a host of channels like call transcripts with prospects, engineering design docs, IT runbooks, customer support email exchanges, project management tickets, and more. As fast moving teams scale up, information gets spread out and more disorganized.\\nSince it quickly becomes infeasible to check across every source, decisions get made on incomplete information, employee satisfaction decreases, and the most valuable members of your team are tied up with constant distractions as junior teammates are unable to unblock themselves. Onyx solves this problem by letting anyone on the team access all of the knowledge across your organization in a permissioned and secure way. Users can ask questions in natural language and get back answers and documents across all of the connected sources instantly.\\n\\nWhats the Real Cost?\\nA typical knowledge worker spends over 2 hours a week on search, but more than that, the cost of incomplete or incorrect information can be extremely high. Customer support/success that isnt able to find the reference to similar cases could cause hours or even days of delay leading to lower customer satisfaction or in the worst case - churn. An account exec not realizing that a prospect had previously mentioned a specific need could lead to lost deals. An engineer not realizing a similar feature had previously been built could result in weeks of wasted development time and tech debt with duplicate implementation. With a lack of knowledge, your whole organization is navigating in the dark - inefficient and mistake prone.\\n\\nMore than Search\\nWhen analyzing the entire corpus of knowledge within your company is as easy as asking a question in a search bar, your entire team can stay informed and up to date. Onyx also makes it trivial to identify where knowledge is well documented and where it is lacking. Team members who are centers of knowledge can begin to effectively document their expertise since it is no longer being thrown into a black hole. All of this allows the organization to achieve higher efficiency and drive business outcomes.\\nWith Generative AI, the entire user experience has evolved as well. For example, instead of just finding similar cases for your customer support team to reference, Onyx breaks down the issue and explains it so that even the most junior members can understand it.\\nThis in turn lets them give the most holistic and technically accurate response possible to your customers. On the other end, even the super stars of your sales team will not be able to review 10 hours of transcripts before hopping on that critical call, but Onyx can easily parse through it in mere seconds and give crucial context to help your team close.\\nUse Cases Overview AI Platform\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nUse Cases\\nEnterprise Search\\nUse Cases\\nEnterprise Search\\nValue of Enterprise Search with Onyx\\n\\nWhat is Enterprise Search and why is it Important?\\nAn Enterprise Search system gives team members a single place to access all of the disparate knowledge of an organization.

The aim is to give transparency into our designs. That way you can have peace of mind in using Onyx.\\nAlternatively if youre looking to customize the system or become an open source contributors, this is a great place to start.\\n\\nSystem Architecture\\nWhether deploying Onyx on a single instance or a container orchestration platform, the flow of data is the same. Documents are pulled and processed via connectors and then persisted in Vespa/Postgres which run in containers within your system.\\nThe only time sensitive data leaves your Onyx setup is when it makes a call to an LLM to generate an answer. The communications to the LLM are encrypted. The data persistence at the LLM API depends on the terms of the LLM hosting service you are using.\\nWe also note that Onyx has some very limited and anonymous telemetry to help us improve the system by identifying bottlenecks and flaky data connectors. You can turn off the telemetry with by setting the DISABLE_TELEMETRY env variable to True.\\n\\nEmbedding Flow\\nEach document is split into smaller sections called Chunks.\\nBy passing chunks to the LLM instead of full documents, we are able to reduce noise to the model by only passing in the relevant sections of the document. Additionally this is significantly more cost efficient as LLM services generally charge per token. Finally by embedding chunks rather than full documents, we are able to retain more detail as each vector embedding is only capable of encoding a limited amount of information.\\nThe addition of mini-chunks takes this concept even further. By embedding at different sizes, Onyx can retrieve both high level context and details. Mini-chunks can also be turned on/off via environment variables as generating multiple vectors per chunk can slow down document indexing if deployed on less capable hardware.\\nIn choosing our embedding model, we use the latest state-of-the-art biencoder that is small enough to run on CPU while maintaining subsecond document retrieval times.\\n\\nQuery Flow\\nThis flow is often updated as were constantly striving to push the capabilities of the retrieval pipeline with the most recent advancements coming out of research and the opensource community.\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nExplanation of different system components and flows\\nThis page discusses how Onyx works from a high level.

Critical information is saved across a host of channels like call transcripts with prospects, engineering design docs, IT runbooks, customer support email exchanges, project management tickets, and more. As fast moving teams scale up, information gets spread out and more disorganized.\\nSince it quickly becomes infeasible to check across every source, decisions get made on incomplete information, employee satisfaction decreases, and the most valuable members of your team are tied up with constant distractions as junior teammates are unable to unblock themselves. Onyx solves this problem by letting anyone on the team access all of the knowledge across your organization in a permissioned and secure way. Users can ask questions in natural language and get back answers and documents across all of the connected sources instantly.\\n\\nWhats the Real Cost?\\nA typical knowledge worker spends over 2 hours a week on search, but more than that, the cost of incomplete or incorrect information can be extremely high. Customer support/success that isnt able to find the reference to similar cases could cause hours or even days of delay leading to lower customer satisfaction or in the worst case - churn. An account exec not realizing that a prospect had previously mentioned a specific need could lead to lost deals. An engineer not realizing a similar feature had previously been built could result in weeks of wasted development time and tech debt with duplicate implementation. With a lack of knowledge, your whole organization is navigating in the dark - inefficient and mistake prone.\\n\\nMore than Search\\nWhen analyzing the entire corpus of knowledge within your company is as easy as asking a question in a search bar, your entire team can stay informed and up to date. Onyx also makes it trivial to identify where knowledge is well documented and where it is lacking. Team members who are centers of knowledge can begin to effectively document their expertise since it is no longer being thrown into a black hole. All of this allows the organization to achieve higher efficiency and drive business outcomes.\\nWith Generative AI, the entire user experience has evolved as well. For example, instead of just finding similar cases for your customer support team to reference, Onyx breaks down the issue and explains it so that even the most junior members can understand it.\\nThis in turn lets them give the most holistic and technically accurate response possible to your customers. On the other end, even the super stars of your sales team will not be able to review 10 hours of transcripts before hopping on that critical call, but Onyx can easily parse through it in mere seconds and give crucial context to help your team close.\\nUse Cases Overview AI Platform\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nUse Cases\\nEnterprise Search\\nUse Cases\\nEnterprise Search\\nValue of Enterprise Search with Onyx\\n\\nWhat is Enterprise Search and why is it Important?\\nAn Enterprise Search system gives team members a single place to access all of the disparate knowledge of an organization.

Additionally query expansion is applied to rephrase the user query into the target languages.\\nTo address the second point, additional instructions are given to the LLM to respect the input language and to respond in the same language as the user query.\\nNote : The Onyx LLM prompts are still in English, just with added instructions if the user configures multilingual settings (see below). If all of your documents and queries are in some other language, it will be better to simply translate all of Onyxs prompts directly to that target language. You can do so here .\\n\\nConfiguration\\nUnless you are translating the LLM prompts yourself, the configuration for multilingual can be done entirely via environment variables.

The aim is to give transparency into our designs. That way you can have peace of mind in using Onyx.\\nAlternatively if youre looking to customize the system or become an open source contributors, this is a great place to start.\\n\\nSystem Architecture\\nWhether deploying Onyx on a single instance or a container orchestration platform, the flow of data is the same. Documents are pulled and processed via connectors and then persisted in Vespa/Postgres which run in containers within your system.\\nThe only time sensitive data leaves your Onyx setup is when it makes a call to an LLM to generate an answer. The communications to the LLM are encrypted. The data persistence at the LLM API depends on the terms of the LLM hosting service you are using.\\nWe also note that Onyx has some very limited and anonymous telemetry to help us improve the system by identifying bottlenecks and flaky data connectors. You can turn off the telemetry with by setting the DISABLE_TELEMETRY env variable to True.\\n\\nEmbedding Flow\\nEach document is split into smaller sections called Chunks.\\nBy passing chunks to the LLM instead of full documents, we are able to reduce noise to the model by only passing in the relevant sections of the document. Additionally this is significantly more cost efficient as LLM services generally charge per token. Finally by embedding chunks rather than full documents, we are able to retain more detail as each vector embedding is only capable of encoding a limited amount of information.\\nThe addition of mini-chunks takes this concept even further. By embedding at different sizes, Onyx can retrieve both high level context and details. Mini-chunks can also be turned on/off via environment variables as generating multiple vectors per chunk can slow down document indexing if deployed on less capable hardware.\\nIn choosing our embedding model, we use the latest state-of-the-art biencoder that is small enough to run on CPU while maintaining subsecond document retrieval times.\\n\\nQuery Flow\\nThis flow is often updated as were constantly striving to push the capabilities of the retrieval pipeline with the most recent advancements coming out of research and the opensource community.\\nAlso note that many of the parameters of this flow such as how much documents to retrieve, how many to rerank, what models to use, which chunks are passed to the LLM, etc. are all configurable.\\nIf there are any questions, dont hesitate to reach out to the maintainers!\\nMultilingual Setup Contact Us\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nExplanation of different system components and flows\\nThis page discusses how Onyx works from a high level.

Youll need this token to configure Onyx to index Notion, so make a copy of it.\\nThe integration has been added to the workspace, so any member can share pages and databases with it. Theres no requirement to be an Admin to share information with an integration.\\n\\nStep 2: Share pages/databases with your integration\\nNow that youve created an integration, you need to grant it access to Notion pages/databases. To keep your information secure, integrations dont have access to any pages or databases in the workspace at first. You must share specific pages with an integration in order for Onyx to access those pages.\\nTo share a page/database with your integration:\\n- Go to the page/database in your workspace.\\n- Click the  on the top right corner of the page.\\n- Scroll to the bottom of the pop-up and click Add connections.\\n- Search for and select the new integration in the Search for connections... menu.\\n- If youve added a page, all child pages also become accesssible to Onyx. If youve added a database, all rows (and their children) become accessible to Onyx.\\nOnce youve granted access to a page/database, you can start configuring Onyx to index those databases.\\n\\nIndexing\\n- Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the Notion connector.\\n- In Step 1 , provide the Integration Token Secret you obtained in the Authorization steps above:\\n- Click the Connect button! Your content will then be pulled into Onyx every 10 minutes.\\nNote - As mentioned, the Notion connector currently indexes everything it has access to.

You can connect up your own teams knowledge and you will be able to ask questions unique to your organization. Onyx will keep all of the knowledge up to date and in sync with your connected applications.\\n\\nIs my data being sent anywhere when I connect it up to Onyx?\\nAnswer: No! Onyx is built with data security as our highest priority. We open sourced it so our users can know exactly what is going on with their data. By default all of the document processing happens within Onyx. The only time it is sent outward is for the GenAI call to generate answers.\\n\\nWhere is the feature for auto sync-ing document level access permissions from all connected sources?\\nAnswer: This falls under the Enterprise Edition set of Onyx features built on top of the MIT/community edition. If you are on Onyx Cloud, you have access to them by default.

The aim is to give transparency into our designs. That way you can have peace of mind in using Onyx.\\nAlternatively if youre looking to customize the system or become an open source contributors, this is a great place to start.\\n\\nSystem Architecture\\nWhether deploying Onyx on a single instance or a container orchestration platform, the flow of data is the same. Documents are pulled and processed via connectors and then persisted in Vespa/Postgres which run in containers within your system.\\nThe only time sensitive data leaves your Onyx setup is when it makes a call to an LLM to generate an answer. The communications to the LLM are encrypted. The data persistence at the LLM API depends on the terms of the LLM hosting service you are using.\\nWe also note that Onyx has some very limited and anonymous telemetry to help us improve the system by identifying bottlenecks and flaky data connectors. You can turn off the telemetry with by setting the DISABLE_TELEMETRY env variable to True.\\n\\nEmbedding Flow\\nEach document is split into smaller sections called Chunks.\\nBy passing chunks to the LLM instead of full documents, we are able to reduce noise to the model by only passing in the relevant sections of the document. Additionally this is significantly more cost efficient as LLM services generally charge per token. Finally by embedding chunks rather than full documents, we are able to retain more detail as each vector embedding is only capable of encoding a limited amount of information.\\nThe addition of mini-chunks takes this concept even further. By embedding at different sizes, Onyx can retrieve both high level context and details. Mini-chunks can also be turned on/off via environment variables as generating multiple vectors per chunk can slow down document indexing if deployed on less capable hardware.\\nIn choosing our embedding model, we use the latest state-of-the-art biencoder that is small enough to run on CPU while maintaining subsecond document retrieval times.\\n\\nQuery Flow\\nThis flow is often updated as were constantly striving to push the capabilities of the retrieval pipeline with the most recent advancements coming out of research and the opensource community.\\nAlso note that many of the parameters of this flow such as how much documents to retrieve, how many to rerank, what models to use, which chunks are passed to the LLM, etc. are all configurable.\\nIf there are any questions, dont hesitate to reach out to the maintainers!\\nMultilingual Setup Contact Us\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nExplanation of different system components and flows\\nThis page discusses how Onyx works from a high level.

Theres no requirement to be an Admin to share information with an integration.\\n\\nStep 2: Share pages/databases with your integration\\nNow that youve created an integration, you need to grant it access to Notion pages/databases. To keep your information secure, integrations dont have access to any pages or databases in the workspace at first. You must share specific pages with an integration in order for Onyx to access those pages.\\nTo share a page/database with your integration:\\n- Go to the page/database in your workspace.\\n- Click the  on the top right corner of the page.\\n- Scroll to the bottom of the pop-up and click Add connections.\\n- Search for and select the new integration in the Search for connections... menu.\\n- If youve added a page, all child pages also become accesssible to Onyx. If youve added a database, all rows (and their children) become accessible to Onyx.\\nOnce youve granted access to a page/database, you can start configuring Onyx to index those databases.\\n\\nIndexing\\n- Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the Notion connector.\\n- In Step 1 , provide the Integration Token Secret you obtained in the Authorization steps above:\\n- Click the Connect button!

Onyx is built with data security as our highest priority. We open sourced it so our users can know exactly what is going on with their data. By default all of the document processing happens within Onyx. The only time it is sent outward is for the GenAI call to generate answers.\\n\\nWhere is the feature for auto sync-ing document level access permissions from all connected sources?\\nAnswer: This falls under the Enterprise Edition set of Onyx features built on top of the MIT/community edition.

The aim is to give transparency into our designs. That way you can have peace of mind in using Onyx.\\nAlternatively if youre looking to customize the system or become an open source contributors, this is a great place to start.\\n\\nSystem Architecture\\nWhether deploying Onyx on a single instance or a container orchestration platform, the flow of data is the same. Documents are pulled and processed via connectors and then persisted in Vespa/Postgres which run in containers within your system.\\nThe only time sensitive data leaves your Onyx setup is when it makes a call to an LLM to generate an answer. The communications to the LLM are encrypted. The data persistence at the LLM API depends on the terms of the LLM hosting service you are using.\\nWe also note that Onyx has some very limited and anonymous telemetry to help us improve the system by identifying bottlenecks and flaky data connectors. You can turn off the telemetry with by setting the DISABLE_TELEMETRY env variable to True.\\n\\nEmbedding Flow\\nEach document is split into smaller sections called Chunks.\\nBy passing chunks to the LLM instead of full documents, we are able to reduce noise to the model by only passing in the relevant sections of the document. Additionally this is significantly more cost efficient as LLM services generally charge per token. Finally by embedding chunks rather than full documents, we are able to retain more detail as each vector embedding is only capable of encoding a limited amount of information.\\nThe addition of mini-chunks takes this concept even further. By embedding at different sizes, Onyx can retrieve both high level context and details. Mini-chunks can also be turned on/off via environment variables as generating multiple vectors per chunk can slow down document indexing if deployed on less capable hardware.\\nIn choosing our embedding model, we use the latest state-of-the-art biencoder that is small enough to run on CPU while maintaining subsecond document retrieval times.\\n\\nQuery Flow\\nThis flow is often updated as were constantly striving to push the capabilities of the retrieval pipeline with the most recent advancements coming out of research and the opensource community.\\nAlso note that many of the parameters of this flow such as how much documents to retrieve, how many to rerank, what models to use, which chunks are passed to the LLM, etc. are all configurable.\\nIf there are any questions, dont hesitate to reach out to the maintainers!\\nMultilingual Setup Contact Us\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nExplanation of different system components and flows\\nThis page discusses how Onyx works from a high level.

Youll need this token to configure Onyx to index Notion, so make a copy of it.\\nThe integration has been added to the workspace, so any member can share pages and databases with it. Theres no requirement to be an Admin to share information with an integration.\\n\\nStep 2: Share pages/databases with your integration\\nNow that youve created an integration, you need to grant it access to Notion pages/databases. To keep your information secure, integrations dont have access to any pages or databases in the workspace at first. You must share specific pages with an integration in order for Onyx to access those pages.\\nTo share a page/database with your integration:\\n- Go to the page/database in your workspace.\\n- Click the  on the top right corner of the page.\\n- Scroll to the bottom of the pop-up and click Add connections.\\n- Search for and select the new integration in the Search for connections... menu.\\n- If youve added a page, all child pages also become accesssible to Onyx. If youve added a database, all rows (and their children) become accessible to Onyx.\\nOnce youve granted access to a page/database, you can start configuring Onyx to index those databases.\\n\\nIndexing\\n- Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the Notion connector.\\n- In Step 1 , provide the Integration Token Secret you obtained in the Authorization steps above:\\n- Click the Connect button! Your content will then be pulled into Onyx every 10 minutes.\\nNote - As mentioned, the Notion connector currently indexes everything it has access to.

You can connect up your own teams knowledge and you will be able to ask questions unique to your organization. Onyx will keep all of the knowledge up to date and in sync with your connected applications.\\n\\nIs my data being sent anywhere when I connect it up to Onyx?\\nAnswer: No! Onyx is built with data security as our highest priority. We open sourced it so our users can know exactly what is going on with their data. By default all of the document processing happens within Onyx. The only time it is sent outward is for the GenAI call to generate answers.\\n\\nWhere is the feature for auto sync-ing document level access permissions from all connected sources?\\nAnswer: This falls under the Enterprise Edition set of Onyx features built on top of the MIT/community edition. If you are on Onyx Cloud, you have access to them by default.

The aim is to give transparency into our designs. That way you can have peace of mind in using Onyx.\\nAlternatively if youre looking to customize the system or become an open source contributors, this is a great place to start.\\n\\nSystem Architecture\\nWhether deploying Onyx on a single instance or a container orchestration platform, the flow of data is the same. Documents are pulled and processed via connectors and then persisted in Vespa/Postgres which run in containers within your system.\\nThe only time sensitive data leaves your Onyx setup is when it makes a call to an LLM to generate an answer. The communications to the LLM are encrypted. The data persistence at the LLM API depends on the terms of the LLM hosting service you are using.\\nWe also note that Onyx has some very limited and anonymous telemetry to help us improve the system by identifying bottlenecks and flaky data connectors. You can turn off the telemetry with by setting the DISABLE_TELEMETRY env variable to True.\\n\\nEmbedding Flow\\nEach document is split into smaller sections called Chunks.\\nBy passing chunks to the LLM instead of full documents, we are able to reduce noise to the model by only passing in the relevant sections of the document. Additionally this is significantly more cost efficient as LLM services generally charge per token. Finally by embedding chunks rather than full documents, we are able to retain more detail as each vector embedding is only capable of encoding a limited amount of information.\\nThe addition of mini-chunks takes this concept even further. By embedding at different sizes, Onyx can retrieve both high level context and details. Mini-chunks can also be turned on/off via environment variables as generating multiple vectors per chunk can slow down document indexing if deployed on less capable hardware.\\nIn choosing our embedding model, we use the latest state-of-the-art biencoder that is small enough to run on CPU while maintaining subsecond document retrieval times.\\n\\nQuery Flow\\nThis flow is often updated as were constantly striving to push the capabilities of the retrieval pipeline with the most recent advancements coming out of research and the opensource community.\\nAlso note that many of the parameters of this flow such as how much documents to retrieve, how many to rerank, what models to use, which chunks are passed to the LLM, etc. are all configurable.\\nIf there are any questions, dont hesitate to reach out to the maintainers!\\nMultilingual Setup Contact Us\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nExplanation of different system components and flows\\nThis page discusses how Onyx works from a high level.

Onyx is built with data security as our highest priority. We open sourced it so our users can know exactly what is going on with their data. By default all of the document processing happens within Onyx. The only time it is sent outward is for the GenAI call to generate answers.\\n\\nWhere is the feature for auto sync-ing document level access permissions from all connected sources?\\nAnswer: This falls under the Enterprise Edition set of Onyx features built on top of the MIT/community edition.

This page contains an exhaustive list of all the options.\\nThere are defaults set in the code so changing/settings these values is not required to use Onyx. A few notable settings that are more frequently changed however are the following:\\n- AUTH_TYPE (default value is disabled )\\n- MULTILINGUAL_QUERY_EXPANSION (you can provide a comma separated list of languages for query rephrasing such as English,French )\\n- LOG_LEVEL (default is info )\\n- WEB_DOMAIN (your full url in production, including the protocol- e.g. https://www.onyx.app )\\n\\nDocker Compose\\nThere are several ways to configure environment variables for the containers. For Docker Compose, there are many ways to pass environment variables to the container, any of the standard approaches will work. However the preferred approach for Onyx is to use the .env file. To do this, create a file called .env at onyx/deployment/docker_compose/.env . From there, populate it with the values you want to override:\\n# Configures basic email/password based login AUTH_TYPE=\\\"basic\\\" # Rephrasing the query into different languages to improve search recall MULTILINGUAL_QUERY_EXPANSION=\\\"English,Spanish,German\\\" # Set a cheaper/faster LLM for the flows that are easier (such as translating the query etc.) FAST_GEN_AI_MODEL_VERSION=\\\"gpt-3.5-turbo\\\" # Setting more verbose logging LOG_LEVEL=\\\"debug\\\" LOG_ALL_MODEL_INTERACTIONS=\\\"true\\\"\\n\\nKubernetes\\nFor Kubernetes, the deployment yaml files includes an Environment ConfigMap.

These assistants can be configured to handle a wide range of tasks, from answering HR queries to assisting with technical support. This guide will walk you through the process of creating an effective assistant using Onyxs platform.\\n\\nConfiguration Options\\nWhen creating an assistant in Onyx, you have several configuration options:\\n- Name : The identifier for your assistant\\n- Description : A brief overview of the assistants purpose and capabilities\\n- System Prompt : Defines the assistants role and overall behavior\\n- Task Prompt : Specifies how the assistant should handle user queries\\n- Tools : Available integrations and capabilities\\n- Starter Messages : Initial messages to guide user interaction\\n- LLM Provider : The language model powering your assistant\\n\\nUnderstanding Different Prompt Types\\nOnyx uses two main types of prompts when configuring an assistant: the System Prompt and the Task Prompt (Additional Instructions). Understanding the difference between these is crucial for creating an effective assistant.\\n\\nSystem Prompt\\nThe System Prompt sets the overall context and behavior of your assistant. It defines:\\n- The assistants role\\n- General behavioral guidelines\\n- Any limitations or restrictions\\nThe System Prompt is like giving your assistant its job description and what its purpose is.\\nExample System Prompt:\\nYou are an HR assistant for Onyx Inc. You have access to the company's HR policies, benefits packages, and procedures. Maintain a professional and friendly tone in all interactions. If you're unsure about any information, advise the user to contact the HR department directly. Do not make up information or policies.\\n\\nTask Prompt\\nThe Task Prompt provides specific instructions on how the assistant should handle and respond to user queries. It defines:\\n- Steps to follow for each query\\n- How to process and present information\\n- When to ask for clarification\\n- How to handle different types of requests\\nThe Task Prompt is like giving your assistant a specific protocol for handling each interaction.\\nExample Task Prompt:\\nFollow these steps when responding to a user query: 1. Identify the main HR topic or policy in the user's question. 2. Search the provided HR documents for relevant information. 3. Summarize the applicable policy or procedure in clear, concise language. 4. If multiple policies apply, list them in order of relevance. 5. Provide the source document and section for your information. 6.\\nIf the query is unclear, ask the user for clarification before providing an answer. 7. If the query is outside your knowledge base, politely direct the user to contact the HR department.\\n\\nTesting and Refinement\\nAfter creating your assistant:\\n- Conduct test runs with various queries\\n- Gather feedback from a small group of users\\n- Use Onyxs analytics tools to identify areas for improvement\\n- Regularly update and refine your assistant based on feedback and changing needs\\n\\nSharing and Permissions\\n- Determine the appropriate access level for the assistant (e.g., specific departments, entire organization)\\n- Utilize Onyxs group features to manage access efficiently\\n- Consider creating multiple versions of an assistant for different user groups if needed\\nBy carefully configuring these elements, you can create a Onyx assistant that effectively serves your organizations needs, providing accurate and helpful responses to user queries.\\nEnterprise Edition Configuration LLM Providers\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nGuides\\nCreating Assistants\\nGuides\\nCreating Assistants\\nA comprehensive guide to creating and configuring AI assistants in Onyx\\n\\nIntroduction\\nOnyx empowers you to create custom AI assistants tailored to your specific needs.

Critical information is saved across a host of channels like call transcripts with prospects, engineering design docs, IT runbooks, customer support email exchanges, project management tickets, and more. As fast moving teams scale up, information gets spread out and more disorganized.\\nSince it quickly becomes infeasible to check across every source, decisions get made on incomplete information, employee satisfaction decreases, and the most valuable members of your team are tied up with constant distractions as junior teammates are unable to unblock themselves. Onyx solves this problem by letting anyone on the team access all of the knowledge across your organization in a permissioned and secure way. Users can ask questions in natural language and get back answers and documents across all of the connected sources instantly.\\n\\nWhats the Real Cost?\\nA typical knowledge worker spends over 2 hours a week on search, but more than that, the cost of incomplete or incorrect information can be extremely high. Customer support/success that isnt able to find the reference to similar cases could cause hours or even days of delay leading to lower customer satisfaction or in the worst case - churn. An account exec not realizing that a prospect had previously mentioned a specific need could lead to lost deals. An engineer not realizing a similar feature had previously been built could result in weeks of wasted development time and tech debt with duplicate implementation. With a lack of knowledge, your whole organization is navigating in the dark - inefficient and mistake prone.\\n\\nMore than Search\\nWhen analyzing the entire corpus of knowledge within your company is as easy as asking a question in a search bar, your entire team can stay informed and up to date. Onyx also makes it trivial to identify where knowledge is well documented and where it is lacking. Team members who are centers of knowledge can begin to effectively document their expertise since it is no longer being thrown into a black hole. All of this allows the organization to achieve higher efficiency and drive business outcomes.\\nWith Generative AI, the entire user experience has evolved as well. For example, instead of just finding similar cases for your customer support team to reference, Onyx breaks down the issue and explains it so that even the most junior members can understand it.\\nThis in turn lets them give the most holistic and technically accurate response possible to your customers. On the other end, even the super stars of your sales team will not be able to review 10 hours of transcripts before hopping on that critical call, but Onyx can easily parse through it in mere seconds and give crucial context to help your team close.\\nUse Cases Overview AI Platform\", \"blurb\": \"This in turn lets them give the most holistic and technically accurate response possible to your customers.

The color palette is defined in two main files:\\n- web/tailwind-themes/tailwind.config.js : This file contains the base Tailwind configuration, including color definitions.\\n- web/src/app/globals.css : This file defines CSS variables for colors, which are then used in the Tailwind config.\\nTo customize the color palette of Onyx, you can:\\n- Navigate to web/src/app/globals.css\\n- Customize the base color palette (for example, create different accent colors, background colors, etc.)\\nTo choose specific colors for a given set of UI elements, you can:\\n- Navigate to web/tailwind-themes/tailwind.config.js .\\n- Override any values specified in the base tailwind.config.js file.\\nAlternatively, to customize all these colors, you can:\\n- Navigate to web/tailwind-themes .\\n- Create a new folder with the name of your organization.\\n- Create a tailwind.config.js file in this new folder.\\n- Override any values specified in the base tailwind.config.js file.\\n- Set NEXT_PUBLIC_THEME to the name of your organization (e.g. the same name as the folder you created in step 2).\\nFor example, if you wanted to make the background black, you could use:\\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */ module.exports = { theme: { extend: { colors: { \\\"background\\\": \\\"#000000\\\", }, }, }, };\\nNOTE: for these changes to apply, you will need to build Onyx from source.

The aim is to give transparency into our designs. That way you can have peace of mind in using Onyx.\\nAlternatively if youre looking to customize the system or become an open source contributors, this is a great place to start.\\n\\nSystem Architecture\\nWhether deploying Onyx on a single instance or a container orchestration platform, the flow of data is the same. Documents are pulled and processed via connectors and then persisted in Vespa/Postgres which run in containers within your system.\\nThe only time sensitive data leaves your Onyx setup is when it makes a call to an LLM to generate an answer. The communications to the LLM are encrypted. The data persistence at the LLM API depends on the terms of the LLM hosting service you are using.\\nWe also note that Onyx has some very limited and anonymous telemetry to help us improve the system by identifying bottlenecks and flaky data connectors. You can turn off the telemetry with by setting the DISABLE_TELEMETRY env variable to True.\\n\\nEmbedding Flow\\nEach document is split into smaller sections called Chunks.\\nBy passing chunks to the LLM instead of full documents, we are able to reduce noise to the model by only passing in the relevant sections of the document. Additionally this is significantly more cost efficient as LLM services generally charge per token. Finally by embedding chunks rather than full documents, we are able to retain more detail as each vector embedding is only capable of encoding a limited amount of information.\\nThe addition of mini-chunks takes this concept even further. By embedding at different sizes, Onyx can retrieve both high level context and details. Mini-chunks can also be turned on/off via environment variables as generating multiple vectors per chunk can slow down document indexing if deployed on less capable hardware.\\nIn choosing our embedding model, we use the latest state-of-the-art biencoder that is small enough to run on CPU while maintaining subsecond document retrieval times.\\n\\nQuery Flow\\nThis flow is often updated as were constantly striving to push the capabilities of the retrieval pipeline with the most recent advancements coming out of research and the opensource community.\\nAlso note that many of the parameters of this flow such as how much documents to retrieve, how many to rerank, what models to use, which chunks are passed to the LLM, etc. are all configurable.\\nIf there are any questions, dont hesitate to reach out to the maintainers!\\nMultilingual Setup Contact Us\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nExplanation of different system components and flows\\nThis page discusses how Onyx works from a high level.

Youll need this token to configure Onyx to index Notion, so make a copy of it.\\nThe integration has been added to the workspace, so any member can share pages and databases with it. Theres no requirement to be an Admin to share information with an integration.\\n\\nStep 2: Share pages/databases with your integration\\nNow that youve created an integration, you need to grant it access to Notion pages/databases. To keep your information secure, integrations dont have access to any pages or databases in the workspace at first. You must share specific pages with an integration in order for Onyx to access those pages.\\nTo share a page/database with your integration:\\n- Go to the page/database in your workspace.\\n- Click the  on the top right corner of the page.\\n- Scroll to the bottom of the pop-up and click Add connections.\\n- Search for and select the new integration in the Search for connections... menu.\\n- If youve added a page, all child pages also become accesssible to Onyx. If youve added a database, all rows (and their children) become accessible to Onyx.\\nOnce youve granted access to a page/database, you can start configuring Onyx to index those databases.\\n\\nIndexing\\n- Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the Notion connector.\\n- In Step 1 , provide the Integration Token Secret you obtained in the Authorization steps above:\\n- Click the Connect button!

You can connect up your own teams knowledge and you will be able to ask questions unique to your organization. Onyx will keep all of the knowledge up to date and in sync with your connected applications.\\n\\nIs my data being sent anywhere when I connect it up to Onyx?\\nAnswer: No! Onyx is built with data security as our highest priority. We open sourced it so our users can know exactly what is going on with their data. By default all of the document processing happens within Onyx. The only time it is sent outward is for the GenAI call to generate answers.\\n\\nWhere is the feature for auto sync-ing document level access permissions from all connected sources?\\nAnswer: This falls under the Enterprise Edition set of Onyx features built on top of the MIT/community edition.

The aim is to give transparency into our designs. That way you can have peace of mind in using Onyx.\\nAlternatively if youre looking to customize the system or become an open source contributors, this is a great place to start.\\n\\nSystem Architecture\\nWhether deploying Onyx on a single instance or a container orchestration platform, the flow of data is the same. Documents are pulled and processed via connectors and then persisted in Vespa/Postgres which run in containers within your system.\\nThe only time sensitive data leaves your Onyx setup is when it makes a call to an LLM to generate an answer. The communications to the LLM are encrypted. The data persistence at the LLM API depends on the terms of the LLM hosting service you are using.\\nWe also note that Onyx has some very limited and anonymous telemetry to help us improve the system by identifying bottlenecks and flaky data connectors. You can turn off the telemetry with by setting the DISABLE_TELEMETRY env variable to True.\\n\\nEmbedding Flow\\nEach document is split into smaller sections called Chunks.\\nBy passing chunks to the LLM instead of full documents, we are able to reduce noise to the model by only passing in the relevant sections of the document. Additionally this is significantly more cost efficient as LLM services generally charge per token. Finally by embedding chunks rather than full documents, we are able to retain more detail as each vector embedding is only capable of encoding a limited amount of information.\\nThe addition of mini-chunks takes this concept even further. By embedding at different sizes, Onyx can retrieve both high level context and details. Mini-chunks can also be turned on/off via environment variables as generating multiple vectors per chunk can slow down document indexing if deployed on less capable hardware.\\nIn choosing our embedding model, we use the latest state-of-the-art biencoder that is small enough to run on CPU while maintaining subsecond document retrieval times.\\n\\nQuery Flow\\nThis flow is often updated as were constantly striving to push the capabilities of the retrieval pipeline with the most recent advancements coming out of research and the opensource community.\\nAlso note that many of the parameters of this flow such as how much documents to retrieve, how many to rerank, what models to use, which chunks are passed to the LLM, etc. are all configurable.\\nIf there are any questions, dont hesitate to reach out to the maintainers!\\nMultilingual Setup Contact Us\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nExplanation of different system components and flows\\nThis page discusses how Onyx works from a high level.

Onyx will keep all of the knowledge up to date and in sync with your connected applications.\\n\\nIs my data being sent anywhere when I connect it up to Onyx?\\nAnswer: No! Onyx is built with data security as our highest priority. We open sourced it so our users can know exactly what is going on with their data. By default all of the document processing happens within Onyx. The only time it is sent outward is for the GenAI call to generate answers.\\n\\nWhere is the feature for auto sync-ing document level access permissions from all connected sources?\\nAnswer: This falls under the Enterprise Edition set of Onyx features built on top of the MIT/community edition.

The aim is to give transparency into our designs. That way you can have peace of mind in using Onyx.\\nAlternatively if youre looking to customize the system or become an open source contributors, this is a great place to start.\\n\\nSystem Architecture\\nWhether deploying Onyx on a single instance or a container orchestration platform, the flow of data is the same. Documents are pulled and processed via connectors and then persisted in Vespa/Postgres which run in containers within your system.\\nThe only time sensitive data leaves your Onyx setup is when it makes a call to an LLM to generate an answer. The communications to the LLM are encrypted. The data persistence at the LLM API depends on the terms of the LLM hosting service you are using.\\nWe also note that Onyx has some very limited and anonymous telemetry to help us improve the system by identifying bottlenecks and flaky data connectors. You can turn off the telemetry with by setting the DISABLE_TELEMETRY env variable to True.\\n\\nEmbedding Flow\\nEach document is split into smaller sections called Chunks.\\nBy passing chunks to the LLM instead of full documents, we are able to reduce noise to the model by only passing in the relevant sections of the document. Additionally this is significantly more cost efficient as LLM services generally charge per token. Finally by embedding chunks rather than full documents, we are able to retain more detail as each vector embedding is only capable of encoding a limited amount of information.\\nThe addition of mini-chunks takes this concept even further. By embedding at different sizes, Onyx can retrieve both high level context and details. Mini-chunks can also be turned on/off via environment variables as generating multiple vectors per chunk can slow down document indexing if deployed on less capable hardware.\\nIn choosing our embedding model, we use the latest state-of-the-art biencoder that is small enough to run on CPU while maintaining subsecond document retrieval times.\\n\\nQuery Flow\\nThis flow is often updated as were constantly striving to push the capabilities of the retrieval pipeline with the most recent advancements coming out of research and the opensource community.\\nAlso note that many of the parameters of this flow such as how much documents to retrieve, how many to rerank, what models to use, which chunks are passed to the LLM, etc. are all configurable.\\nIf there are any questions, dont hesitate to reach out to the maintainers!\\nMultilingual Setup Contact Us\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nExplanation of different system components and flows\\nThis page discusses how Onyx works from a high level.

Onyx makes Generative AI more versatile for work by enabling new types of questions like What is the most common feature request weve heard from customers this month. Whereas other AI systems have no context of your team and are generally unhelpful with work related questions, Onyx makes it possible to ask these questions in natural language and get back answers in seconds.\\nOnyx can connect to +30 different tools and the use cases are not limited to the ones in the following pages. The highlighted use cases are for inspiration and come from feedback gathered from our users and customers.\\n\\nCommon Getting Started Questions:\\n\\nWhy are these docs connected in my Onyx deployment?\\nAnswer: This is just an example of how connectors work in Onyx. You can connect up your own teams knowledge and you will be able to ask questions unique to your organization. Onyx will keep all of the knowledge up to date and in sync with your connected applications.\\n\\nIs my data being sent anywhere when I connect it up to Onyx?\\nAnswer: No! Onyx is built with data security as our highest priority. We open sourced it so our users can know exactly what is going on with their data. By default all of the document processing happens within Onyx. The only time it is sent outward is for the GenAI call to generate answers.\\n\\nWhere is the feature for auto sync-ing document level access permissions from all connected sources?\\nAnswer: This falls under the Enterprise Edition set of Onyx features built on top of the MIT/community edition. If you are on Onyx Cloud, you have access to them by default. If youre running it yourself, reach out to the Onyx team to receive access.\\nAdvanced Curator Examples Enterprise Search\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nUse Cases\\nUse Cases Overview\\nUse Cases\\nUse Cases Overview\\nHow to leverage Onyx in your organization\\n\\nOnyx Overview\\nOnyx is the AI Assistant connected to your organizations docs, apps, and people.

The aim is to give transparency into our designs. That way you can have peace of mind in using Onyx.\\nAlternatively if youre looking to customize the system or become an open source contributors, this is a great place to start.\\n\\nSystem Architecture\\nWhether deploying Onyx on a single instance or a container orchestration platform, the flow of data is the same. Documents are pulled and processed via connectors and then persisted in Vespa/Postgres which run in containers within your system.\\nThe only time sensitive data leaves your Onyx setup is when it makes a call to an LLM to generate an answer. The communications to the LLM are encrypted. The data persistence at the LLM API depends on the terms of the LLM hosting service you are using.\\nWe also note that Onyx has some very limited and anonymous telemetry to help us improve the system by identifying bottlenecks and flaky data connectors. You can turn off the telemetry with by setting the DISABLE_TELEMETRY env variable to True.\\n\\nEmbedding Flow\\nEach document is split into smaller sections called Chunks.\\nBy passing chunks to the LLM instead of full documents, we are able to reduce noise to the model by only passing in the relevant sections of the document. Additionally this is significantly more cost efficient as LLM services generally charge per token. Finally by embedding chunks rather than full documents, we are able to retain more detail as each vector embedding is only capable of encoding a limited amount of information.\\nThe addition of mini-chunks takes this concept even further. By embedding at different sizes, Onyx can retrieve both high level context and details. Mini-chunks can also be turned on/off via environment variables as generating multiple vectors per chunk can slow down document indexing if deployed on less capable hardware.\\nIn choosing our embedding model, we use the latest state-of-the-art biencoder that is small enough to run on CPU while maintaining subsecond document retrieval times.\\n\\nQuery Flow\\nThis flow is often updated as were constantly striving to push the capabilities of the retrieval pipeline with the most recent advancements coming out of research and the opensource community.\\nAlso note that many of the parameters of this flow such as how much documents to retrieve, how many to rerank, what models to use, which chunks are passed to the LLM, etc. are all configurable.\\nIf there are any questions, dont hesitate to reach out to the maintainers!\\nMultilingual Setup Contact Us\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nExplanation of different system components and flows\\nThis page discusses how Onyx works from a high level.

You can connect up your own teams knowledge and you will be able to ask questions unique to your organization. Onyx will keep all of the knowledge up to date and in sync with your connected applications.\\n\\nIs my data being sent anywhere when I connect it up to Onyx?\\nAnswer: No! Onyx is built with data security as our highest priority. We open sourced it so our users can know exactly what is going on with their data. By default all of the document processing happens within Onyx. The only time it is sent outward is for the GenAI call to generate answers.\\n\\nWhere is the feature for auto sync-ing document level access permissions from all connected sources?\\nAnswer: This falls under the Enterprise Edition set of Onyx features built on top of the MIT/community edition.

The aim is to give transparency into our designs. That way you can have peace of mind in using Onyx.\\nAlternatively if youre looking to customize the system or become an open source contributors, this is a great place to start.\\n\\nSystem Architecture\\nWhether deploying Onyx on a single instance or a container orchestration platform, the flow of data is the same. Documents are pulled and processed via connectors and then persisted in Vespa/Postgres which run in containers within your system.\\nThe only time sensitive data leaves your Onyx setup is when it makes a call to an LLM to generate an answer. The communications to the LLM are encrypted. The data persistence at the LLM API depends on the terms of the LLM hosting service you are using.\\nWe also note that Onyx has some very limited and anonymous telemetry to help us improve the system by identifying bottlenecks and flaky data connectors. You can turn off the telemetry with by setting the DISABLE_TELEMETRY env variable to True.\\n\\nEmbedding Flow\\nEach document is split into smaller sections called Chunks.\\nBy passing chunks to the LLM instead of full documents, we are able to reduce noise to the model by only passing in the relevant sections of the document. Additionally this is significantly more cost efficient as LLM services generally charge per token. Finally by embedding chunks rather than full documents, we are able to retain more detail as each vector embedding is only capable of encoding a limited amount of information.\\nThe addition of mini-chunks takes this concept even further. By embedding at different sizes, Onyx can retrieve both high level context and details. Mini-chunks can also be turned on/off via environment variables as generating multiple vectors per chunk can slow down document indexing if deployed on less capable hardware.\\nIn choosing our embedding model, we use the latest state-of-the-art biencoder that is small enough to run on CPU while maintaining subsecond document retrieval times.\\n\\nQuery Flow\\nThis flow is often updated as were constantly striving to push the capabilities of the retrieval pipeline with the most recent advancements coming out of research and the opensource community.\\nAlso note that many of the parameters of this flow such as how much documents to retrieve, how many to rerank, what models to use, which chunks are passed to the LLM, etc. are all configurable.\\nIf there are any questions, dont hesitate to reach out to the maintainers!\\nMultilingual Setup Contact Us\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nWelcome to Onyx\\nSystem Overview\\nExplanation of different system components and flows\\nThis page discusses how Onyx works from a high level.

For follow up indexing runs, the connector only retrieves pages that have been updated since the last indexing attempt. Indexing is configured to run every 10 minutes , so page updates should appear within 10 minutes.\\n\\nSetting up\\n\\nAuthorization\\nIn order to authorize Onyx to connect to your Notion workspace, youll need to create a new integration in Notion, which will then provide you with a secret token.\\nThese steps are pulled from this Notion guide which you can also follow.\\n\\nStep 1: Create an integration\\n- Visit https://www.notion.com/my-integrations in your browser.\\n- Click the + New integration button.\\n- Name the integration (something like Onyx could work).\\n- Select Read content as the only capability required for Onyx.\\n- Click Submit to create the integration.\\nOn the next page, youll find your Notion integration token, also called an API key. Youll need this token to configure Onyx to index Notion, so make a copy of it.\\nThe integration has been added to the workspace, so any member can share pages and databases with it. Theres no requirement to be an Admin to share information with an integration.\\n\\nStep 2: Share pages/databases with your integration\\nNow that youve created an integration, you need to grant it access to Notion pages/databases. To keep your information secure, integrations dont have access to any pages or databases in the workspace at first. You must share specific pages with an integration in order for Onyx to access those pages.\\nTo share a page/database with your integration:\\n- Go to the page/database in your workspace.\\n- Click the  on the top right corner of the page.\\n- Scroll to the bottom of the pop-up and click Add connections.\\n- Search for and select the new integration in the Search for connections... menu.\\n- If youve added a page, all child pages also become accesssible to Onyx. If youve added a database, all rows (and their children) become accessible to Onyx.\\nOnce youve granted access to a page/database, you can start configuring Onyx to index those databases.\\n\\nIndexing\\n- Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the Notion connector.\\n- In Step 1 , provide the Integration Token Secret you obtained in the Authorization steps above:\\n- Click the Connect button! Your content will then be pulled into Onyx every 10 minutes.\\nNote - As mentioned, the Notion connector currently indexes everything it has access to. If you want to limit specific content being indexed, simply unshare the database from Notion with the integration.\\nLinear Connector Oracle Storage Connector\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nConnectors\\nNotion Connector\\nConnectors\\nNotion Connector\\nAccess knowledge from your Notion workspace\\n\\nHow it works\\nThe Notion connector uses the Notion search API to fetch all pages that the connector has access to within a workspace.

The highlighted use cases are for inspiration and come from feedback gathered from our users and customers.\\n\\nCommon Getting Started Questions:\\n\\nWhy are these docs connected in my Onyx deployment?\\nAnswer: This is just an example of how connectors work in Onyx. You can connect up your own teams knowledge and you will be able to ask questions unique to your organization. Onyx will keep all of the knowledge up to date and in sync with your connected applications.\\n\\nIs my data being sent anywhere when I connect it up to Onyx?\\nAnswer: No! Onyx is built with data security as our highest priority. We open sourced it so our users can know exactly what is going on with their data. By default all of the document processing happens within Onyx. The only time it is sent outward is for the GenAI call to generate answers.\\n\\nWhere is the feature for auto sync-ing document level access permissions from all connected sources?\\nAnswer: This falls under the Enterprise Edition set of Onyx features built on top of the MIT/community edition. If you are on Onyx Cloud, you have access to them by default. If youre running it yourself, reach out to the Onyx team to receive access.\\nAdvanced Curator Examples Enterprise Search\", \"blurb\": \"Onyx Documentation home page\\nSearch...\\nNavigation\\nUse Cases\\nUse Cases Overview\\nUse Cases\\nUse Cases Overview\\nHow to leverage Onyx in your organization\\n\\nOnyx Overview\\nOnyx is the AI Assistant connected to your organizations docs, apps, and people.
